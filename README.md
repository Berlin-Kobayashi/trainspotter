#Trainspotter
Trainspotter is a CLI tool which lets you monitor the time it will take until a specific train or bus arrives at a certain station using the Google Maps APIs.

## Getting started
### Requirements
- at least go 1.8
- an Google Maps API key 

### Running Trainspotter
TODO once command line interface is stable 

### Onion Omega
If you are an Onioneer you can take a look into the onion folder which contains scripts for cross compiling go for [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set) and for interacting with Onion Omega components.    

### Ideas
Priority|Idea

1|Make multiple lineNames configurable

5|Add support for config files instead of arguments and options
